# StopWatch

In this project, I've designed a website to display digital stopwatch. StopWatch contains all necessary feature which it requires. This project is made up only 3 languages (HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript)

## Features

- Start timer - 
Once the user clicks the start button, stopwatch will starts from 00m:00s & play and pause will be visible to the user.
- Play/Pause timer - 
Once the stopwatch starts running, user can play and pause the timer whenever they want. The timer will start from the exact time where it was paused.
- Stop timer - 
If the user clicks the stop button, timer will be stopped and will not be resumed from the same time, it will only starts from 00m:00s.
- Reset button - 
Reset button is used to reset the timer, once this button is clicked timer will resets its value to 00m:00s.
